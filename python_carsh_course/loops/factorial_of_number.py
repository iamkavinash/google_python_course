#in math, the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all the integers below it. For example, the factorial of four (4!) is equal to 1*2*3*4=24
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        result = i * result
    return result

print(factorial(4)) # should return 24
print(factorial(5)) # should return 120
